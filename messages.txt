Why is this not working
Yay, it worked!!!!!
Nice! Now we shoould have a conversation. How has your school year been so far?
It has been fun, but a little exhausting and stressful. How yours so far?
Same with mine. I do not have very much homework so far which is really nice! The class I am most worried about is AP Calculus. What is your hardest class?
Aw I'm sorry, AP Calcus sounds difficult. I would have to say Honors Pre-Calc is the hardest for me. 
Honors Pre-Calc was a hard class for me. What made it better was going to the teacher for help. Good luck in that class this year :) 
Thank you! Good Luck to you too!
